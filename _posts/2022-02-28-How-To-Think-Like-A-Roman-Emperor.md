I recently finished reading How To Think Like A Roman Emperor by Donald Robertson. 
In the book, the author draws a comparison between stoicism and modern-day therapy. The book revolves around the life of Marcus Aurelius. This was my first time reading about Stoic philosophy and wanted to share some snippets from the book I liked. 


* Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be; just be one. 

* External advantages such as wealth may create more opportunities but in themselves, they simply don't have the kind of value that can ever define a good life. 

* Our ability to think rationally is what makes us human. Reason governs our decisions, in a sense - the Stoics call it our "ruling faculty". It allows us to evaluate our thoughts, feelings, and urgers and to decide if they're good or bad, healthy or unhealthy. We, therefore, have an innate duty to protect our ability to reason and to use it properly. 

* External things do have some value, but they're not worth getting upset over -it's a different kind of value. If we could put virtue on one side of a set of scales, it wouldn't matter how many gold coins or other indifferent things piled up on the opposing side- it should never tip the balance. 
Nevertheless, some external things are preferable to others, and wisdom consists in our ability to make these sorts of value judgments. Life is preferable to death, wealth is preferable to poverty, health is preferable to sickness, and so on. 

* Social, material, and physical advantages actually give foolish individuals more opportunity to do harm to themselves and others. 

* Stoics had names for many different types of good passion(eupatheiai), a term encompassing both desires and emotions, which they grouped under three broad headings, 
	1. A profound sense of joy or gladness and peace of mind, which comes from living with wisdom and virtue. 
	2. A healthy feeling of aversion to vice, like a sense of conscience, honor, dignity, or integrity.
	3. The desire to help both ourselves and others, through friendship, kindness, and goodwill.

* Seneca noted the paradox that before we can exhibit the virtues of courage and moderation, we need to have at least some trace of fear and desire to overcome. 

* Philosophy is a moral and psychological therapy, often painful to hear because it forces us to admit our own faults in order to remedy them - sometimes the truth hurts. 

* Any emotion can be experienced in the following stages,
	1. Initial impressions automatically impose themselves on your mind, including thoughts and emerging feelings called propatheiai. 
	2. Take a step back from their initial thoughts and feelings and withhold their assent from them. Responding calmly and with courage is more important. 
	3. If you have assented to the impression that something is intrinsically bad or catastrophic, then a full-blown "passion" develops, which can quickly spiral out of control 

* Simplicity frees us from affectation and trouble it brings. 

* When we assign intrinsic values like "good" or "bad" to external events, we're behaving irrationally and even exhibiting a form of self-deception.

* Virtues of speech:
	1. Correct grammar and good vocabulary. 
	2. Clarity of expression, making the ideas easily understood. 
	3. Conciseness, employing no more words than necessary.
	4. Appropriateness of style, suited to the subject matter and apparently to the audience.
	5. Distinction, or artistic excellence, and the avoidance of vulgarity. 

* The way we talk and think about events involves making value judgements, which shape our feelings. 

* If you stick with the facts and don't unnecessarily extrapolate from them, you will put paid to many anxieties in life. 

* Decatastrophizing involves reevaluating the probability and severity of something bad happening and framing it in more realistic terms. 

* It's not things that upset us but our judgments about things. 

* When you strongly judge something to be good or bad, you also commit yourself to saying that you want to obtain or avoid it. But if something is outside your control, then it's simply irrational to demand that you should obtain or avoid it. 

* We should make the effort to acquire an older and wiser friend: one renowned for honestly and plain-speaking, who has mastered the same passions with which we need help, who can properly identify our vices and tell us frankly where we're going astray in life. 

* A wise man should welcome criticism from his friend. 

* Think of nothing which you would be unwilling to say aloud, uncensored, as soon as it comes into your mind. 

* Nothing cheers our soul, like the people close to us exhibiting virtue in their lives, and for that very reason, we should treasure these examples and keep the memory of them fresh. 

* Writing down the virtues possessed by a hypothetical wise man or woman, or those we aspire to ourselves, is usually a very beneficial exercise. 

* Small changes can often have big consequences. 

* There is nothing wrong with pleasure unless we begin craving it so much that we neglect our responsibilities in life or it replaces healthy and fulfilling activities with ones that are not. 

* It's not in feelings but in actions that your supreme good resides. 

* Few ways of increasing positive feelings, 
	1. Planning new activities that are consistent with your core values. 
	2. Contemplating the qualities you admire in other people. 
	3. Practicing gratitude for the things you already have in life. 

* You might write down the short-term pros and cons of the course of action followed by longer-term consequences. Simply realizing that your desires produce negative results can sometimes change the way you feel and behave. 

* It's not things that make us crave them but our judgements about things. 

* Your goal is to replace unfulfilling habits and desires with activities that you find more intrinsically rewarding.

* People risk amplifying their complaints by turning common misfortunes into personal tragedies. 

* Our main concern should always remain the use we are making right now, from moment to moment, of our own mind. 

* Pain is always bearable because it is either acute or chronic but never both. 

* Stress inoculation: you learn to build up resistance to a bigger problem by voluntarily exposing yourself repeatedly to something similar, albeit in smaller doses or milder form. 

* We can preserve our ruling faculty in a peaceful state as long as we don't judge bodily sensations as being intrinsically good or bad. 

* Supreme goal is to live with wisdom and its accompanying virtues. 

* Facing something and accepting it often leads to less injury than approaching it hesitantly and defensively. 

* Struggling against things we can't control does us more harm than good. 

* He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how. 

* The burden of physical pain or illness is light when we look at it objectively, without "drawing concentric circles" around it, which multiply our suffering. 

* If this will seem trivial to me twenty years from now, then why shouldn't I view it as trivial today instead of worrying about it as if it's a catastrophe. 

* Individuals are bound to make moral errors because the majority do not have a firm grasp on the true nature of good and evil. Nobody is born wise, but rather we must become so through education and training. 

* Thoughts related to anger and similar negative commands,
	1. We are naturally social animals, designed to help one another. 
	2. Consider a person's character as a whole. 
	3. Nobody does wrong willingly.
	4. Nobody is perfect, yourself included. 
	5. You can never be certain of other people's motives. 
	6. Remember we all will die. 
	7. It's our own judgment that upsets us. 
	8. Anger does us more harm than good. 
	9. Nature gave us the virtues to deal with anger.
	10. It's madness to expect others to be perfect.
