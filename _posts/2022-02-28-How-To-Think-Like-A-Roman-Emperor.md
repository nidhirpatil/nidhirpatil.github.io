I recently finished reading How To Think Like A Roman Emperor by Donald Robertson. 
In the book, the author draws a comparison between stoicism and modern-day therapy. The book revolves around the life of Marcus Aurelius. This was my first time reading about Stoic philosophy and wanted to share some snippets from the book I liked. 



* Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be; just be one. 

* External advantages such as wealth may create more opportunities but in themselves, they simply don't have the kind of value that can ever define a good life. 

* Our ability to think rationally is what makes us human. Reason governs our decisions, in a sense - the Stoics call it our "ruling faculty". It allows us to evaluate our thoughts, feelings, and urgers and to decide if they're good or bad, healthy or unhealthy. We, therefore, have an innate duty to protect our ability to reason and to uses it properly. 

* External things do have some value, but they're not worth getting upset over -it's a different kind of value. If we could put virtue on one side of a set of scales, it wouldn't matter how many gold coins or other indifferent things piled up on the opposing side- it should never tip the balance. 
Nevertheless, some external things are preferable to others, and wisdom consists in our ability to make these sorts of value judgments. Life is preferable to death, wealth is preferable to poverty, health is preferable to sickness, and so on. 

* Social, material, and physical advantages actually give foolish individuals more opportunity to do harm to themselves and others. 

* Stoics had names for many different types of goof passion(eupatheiai), a term encompassing both desires and emotions, which they grouped under three broad headings, 
	1. A profound sense of joy or gladness and peace of mind, which comes from living with wisdom and virtue. 
	2. A healthy feeling of aversion to vice, like a sense of conscience, honor, dignity, or integrity.
	3. The desire to help both ourselves and others, through friendship, kindness, and goodwill.

* Seneca noted the paradox that before we can exhibit  the virtues of courage and moderation, we need to have at least some trace of fear and desire to overcome. 

* Philosophy is a moral and psychological therapy, often painful to hear because it forces us to admit our own faults in order to remedy them - sometimes the truth hurts. 

* Any emotion can be experienced in the following stages,
	1. Initial impressions automatically impose themselves on your mind, including thoughts and emerging feelings called propatheiai. 
	2. Take a step back from their initial thoughts and feelings and withhold their assent from them. Responding calmly and with courage is more important. 
	3. If you have assented to the impression that something is intrinsically bad or catastrophic, then a full-blown "passion" develops, which can quickly spiral out of control 

* Simplicity frees us from affectation and trouble it brings. 

* When we assign intrinsic values like "good" or "bad" to external events, we're behaving irrationally and even exhibiting a form of self-deception.

* to be continued.
